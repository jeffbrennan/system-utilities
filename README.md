Assorted scripts to make work easier

## file-deleter

Deletes all files within a directory while preserving its subfolders

This is an issue that I ran into while analyzing data for work. After making some substantial changes to an analysis script, I copied all of the visualizations and code over to a new version folder. Some of the graphs in the /viz folder were no longer being generated. This meant I had to manually remove the obsolete graphs in each folder before running the new script.

file-deleter.py now does this automatically and tells me how many files it deleted.
